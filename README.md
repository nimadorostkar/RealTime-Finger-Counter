# Finger-Counter
This project leverages the MediaPipe framework to develop a computer vision model capable of accurately counting the number of fingers displayed by the user's hand in real-time. It also includes an interactive game component where the system prompts the user to replicate the number correctly.

# Real-time Interaction
The game provides real-time interaction, where the user's performance is immediately assessed. The results are displayed on the screen, indicating whether the user correctly replicated the prompted number.
